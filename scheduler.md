# Scheduler

- Short-term scheduler: selects which process should be executed next and allocates CPU to it. (Ready state => Run state)
- Long-term scheduler: selects which processes should be **loaded into memory** and brought into the ready queue. (New state => Ready state)
- Medium-term scheduler: selects which processes should be **swapped in and out** of memory. (Ready state => Wait state)
